As part of a team-based project at the **Faculty of Organization and Informatics**, we designed and developed a portfolio website dedicated to the actor **Keanu Reeves**. The goal of the project was to apply web design principles and usability concepts while building a clean and structured portfolio-style website.

Although the project was team-based, I was primarily responsible for **designing and developing the website**, including the overall layout structure, HTML and CSS implementation, and basic UI logic. The focus was on creating a visually consistent and user-friendly interface that presents information clearly and intuitively.

The project followed a **structured development process**. We started with user research to define the target audience and expected content, followed by wireframing and prototyping to plan the layout and navigation. After that, the design was translated into a functional website using standard web technologies.

Special attention was given to **usability and UI consistency**, such as spacing, typography, navigation flow, and visual hierarchy. The project helped me better understand how design decisions affect user experience and how to translate abstract requirements into a working web interface.

This project strengthened my practical skills in **HTML and CSS**, improved my sense for layout and visual structure, and provided valuable experience in collaborative web development.
