While studying blockchain technologies, I worked on a research project focused on the Solidity programming language and its ability to return multiple data types from a single function. The main goal of the project was to explore how Solidity handles data types and functions, and why returning multiple values can improve smart contract design.

The documentation starts with an overview of blockchain technology and the role of Solidity as a high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It then introduces Solidity data types, divided into **value types** (such as `bool`, `uint`, `address`, `bytes`, and `enum`) and **reference types** (such as `array`, `string`, `struct`, and `mapping`).

A key part of the project focuses on Solidity functions — their syntax, visibility (`public`, `external`, `internal`, `private`), and special types like `view` and `pure`. Through practical examples, the project demonstrates how a single function can return multiple values at once, instead of using multiple separate functions. This approach results in cleaner code, better readability, and reduced gas costs.

The documentation also covers more advanced examples, such as combining multiple data types using `struct` and `array`, showing how complex data structures can be returned and managed efficiently within smart contracts.

Overall, this project helped me better understand Solidity’s design philosophy and why returning multiple data types is an important feature for writing efficient, maintainable, and gas-optimized smart contracts.
