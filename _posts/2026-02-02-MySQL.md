As part of my coursework, I worked on a seminar project focused on **MySQL**, one of the most widely used open-source relational database management systems. The goal of the project was to gain practical experience with database creation, management, and modeling using **MySQL Workbench** together with **XAMPP** as a local server environment.

The project begins with an overview of MySQL, its history, and its role in modern web applications. MySQL is commonly used as part of the LAMP stack and powers many well-known platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, and phpBB. Understanding how it works is an essential skill for anyone working with backend systems or data-driven applications.

A large part of the work focused on **installing and configuring MySQL Workbench and XAMPP**, followed by establishing a local database connection. Using this setup, I created databases and tables both by writing raw SQL queries and by using the graphical interface provided by MySQL Workbench. This approach helped demonstrate how beginners can work with databases even without deep SQL knowledge, while still understanding what happens behind the scenes.

The project also covered **database modeling using EER diagrams**, including creating relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Visual modeling made it easier to understand table structure, foreign keys, and data relationships, which are crucial concepts when designing scalable databases.

In the final part of the seminar, MySQL was compared with **PostgreSQL**, highlighting differences in performance, extensibility, standards compliance, and use cases. While both systems are powerful and widely used, MySQL proved to be particularly suitable for learning environments due to its simplicity, tooling, and strong community support.

Overall, this project helped me build a solid foundation in relational databases, SQL basics, and practical database design. It reinforced the importance of proper data modeling and showed how graphical tools can significantly speed up development and learning.
