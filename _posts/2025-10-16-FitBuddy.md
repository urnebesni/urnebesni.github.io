FitBuddy is a mobile application prototype designed to improve communication between personal trainers and gym members. The main goal of the application is to simplify trainers’ daily workflows while providing users with clear, fast, and well-organized access to training-related information.

The prototype was developed as part of the *Computer Systems Management* course at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Varaždin. The project was created in a team of three students: **Mihael Brlečić**, **Milan Vukasović**, and **Tomislav Smetiško**, under the mentorship of **Assoc. Prof. Renata Mekovec, PhD**.

### Project overview

FitBuddy is intended for:
- personal trainers who manage multiple clients
- gym members who want structured access to workouts, schedules, and communication

The prototype focuses on:
- clear and consistent navigation
- a minimal and user-friendly interface
- realistic business processes used in fitness centers
- interactive elements such as user flows, navigation paths, and screen transitions

### Evaluation and results

The prototype was evaluated based on several criteria, including:
- completeness and structure of functionalities
- coverage of real-world business processes
- application navigation
- UI consistency (colors, fonts, icons)
- interactivity of the prototype

The project received **maximum points**, confirming that the prototype successfully met all evaluation requirements.
