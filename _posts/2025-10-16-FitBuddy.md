Me, Milan Vukasović and Tomislav Smetiško made a prototype for a mobile application for personal trainers called FitBuddy. The prototype of the application was made as part of a project from the course Computer Systems Management at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Varaždin. Our mentor for the application was Assoc. prof. dr. sc. Mekovec Renata. The application is intended for personal trainers and certain users who are members of the gym. It enables easier communication between the personal trainer and the user, makes the personal trainer's job easier with a simple and minimal interface and provides the user with organized access and a fast flow of information. We were working on this from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022.
