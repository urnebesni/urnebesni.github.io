As part of my coursework, I worked on a video project focused on creating a promotional product review video. The goal was to design, record, and edit an unboxing and review of the **Aigo Q719 wireless mouse**, following a complete production workflow.

The project covered all main phases of video production — **preproduction, production, and postproduction**. During preproduction, I planned the video structure, defined the target audience, and prepared a simple shooting script. The idea was to present the product honestly by highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses, especially as a budget-friendly wireless mouse.

The production phase involved recording video footage using a smartphone setup and capturing audio separately to improve clarity. The review included unboxing, basic setup, usability testing, DPI switching, and a comparison with another low-cost mouse. A short promotional version of the video was also created for social media.

In postproduction, I edited the video using **DaVinci Resolve**, focusing on pacing, transitions, audio balancing, and basic visual consistency. One of the main challenges was synchronizing voice recordings with video clips and correcting low microphone volume, which required additional audio adjustments.

Overall, this project helped me better understand practical video production, especially the importance of planning, sound quality, and postproduction workflow. It was a valuable hands-on experience in creating structured media content for promotional and informational purposes.
